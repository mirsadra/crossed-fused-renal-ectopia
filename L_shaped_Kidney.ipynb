There was a history of generalized weakness, weight loss, and loss of appetite during this period. On examination, the patient was poorly nourished with the presence of a palpable left-sided abdominal mass. Ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen showed the presence of right ectopic kidney and left-sided hydronephrosis. A heterogeneous mass was noted in the left kidney. Another polypoidal mass was also seen in the lumen of the urinary bladder, attached to its posterolateral wall. Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) of the abdomen helped in the renal anatomy and characterization of the mass, which revealed L-shaped crossed fused renal ectopia. The right kidney was not present in the right renal fossa and was in the midline, anterior to the aortic bifurcation at the L4-L5 level. It was malrotated and fused with the lower pole of the left kidney. The left kidney was enlarged, with a large soft heterogeneous tissue density mass involving the interpolar and lower pole regions that exhibited heterogeneous enhancement with central non-enhancing areas. Few calcified foci were seen in the mass, along with moderate hydronephrosis. In the delayed phase (15 minutes), no contrast excretion from the left kidney was recorded. The interpolar region of the right kidney was contiguously infiltrated by the left lower pole renal mass. Small tumor thrombi were present in the segmental right renal veins draining the interpolar region. Aortocaval, para-aortic and left renal hilar lymphadenopathy were also noted.\",\n",

She reported several episodes of urinary-tract infections in the past. Her past surgical history was irrelevant to this case. She had no significant family history. Upon physical examination, the patient presented hyperthermia (39 °C), tachycardia (120 beats per minute), and blood pressure of 110/85 mmHg. There was suprapubic tenderness and left flank tenderness at percussion. Gynecological ex- amination was normal. Analytical evaluation revealed an elevated white blood cell (25*10) with 71% neutrophils, an elevated protein C reaction (150 mg/dl). Urine tested positive for leucocytes and protei- nuria but negative for red blood cells. The patient was admitted with the diagnostic of acute pyelonephritis and treatment was started em- pirically with ampicillin after urine and blood culture were performed. Despite treatment, the fever persisted and the patient's condition did not improve. Urine culture was positive for E. Coli. Antibiotics had been ineffective in controlling pyosepsis.\",\n",
